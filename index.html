    <h3>Hello, my name is Stiven</h3>
    <h6>I forgor how to be a webdev</h6>
    <hr>

    <p>Let's start figuring out how we're gonna make this website work</p>

    <p>how tf do i make a list (i figured it out [i had it wrong this whole time lol])</p>
    <h4>What I want:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>It'd be nice to have it be somewhat modern cause I like that</li>
        <li>start with an intro and maybe small bio of who i am what i like to do/work on</li>
        <li>include actual portfolio of work (how do i nest lists)</li>
        <li>maybe with projects for now just including github links will work [i mean yeah no shit better to get soemthhing working first]</li>
        <ul>
            <li>dedicate a page to a large-scale project</li>
            <li>smaller ones can maybe have like a gallery with popup window explanations or sum</li>
        </ul>
        <li>also how do i actually wanna run this joint cause god forbid i learn javascript so maybe flask again yuck [i will in fact probably need to learn javascript but ill be using Flask again aha ha]</li>
        <li>finally maybe add socials idk its not like i use them anyway oh a including my resume would also be good</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>well shiet i'm gonna hvae to find somewhere to host this lmao so i guess github will stay as just a repo</h3>
